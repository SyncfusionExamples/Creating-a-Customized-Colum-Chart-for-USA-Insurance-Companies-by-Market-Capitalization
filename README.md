# Creating a Customized Colum Chart for USA Insurance Companies by Market Capitalization

A column chart is a graphical representation that visually showcases various categories through vertical columns. In this case, the column chart has been customised to exhibit the leading insurance companies in the United States, delineating their 2022 market capitalization.

The column series has been creatively revamped using a Path implementation, resulting in uniquely designed rectangular segments. Each column is now fashioned with a distinct rectangular shape culminating in a triangular apex, significantly enhancing its visual allure. This modification contributes to a superior visualization, making it effortless for viewers to comprehend and seamlessly compare the data. The novel design not only adds aesthetic appeal but also improves the chart's functionality by simplifying the comparison process, allowing for clearer insights into the represented information.
